# URLL Shortcut path

Shortcut paths are a new feature in URLL V2.x and beyond. They are only available in `.urll` files that have a [shebang](/Docs/V2/Shebang/)

A version 2 shortcut path looks like this:

```urll
--URLL:"///home/<username>/Desktop/MyList1.urll";
```

For repositories, or linking from the root of a directory system, it can be written like this:

```urll
--URLL:"/<FolderName>/MyList1.urll";
```

It is an extra feature.
